## Introduction

Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request (for example, Ruby, Python, or PHP based website), static site generator builds pages when you create or update your content.

The purpose of website generators is to render content into HTML files. Most are “dynamic site generators.” That means the HTTP server—i.e., the program that sends files to the browser to be viewed—runs the generator to create a new HTML file every time an end user requests a page.

Over time, dynamic site generators were programmed to cache their HTML files to prevent unnecessary delays in delivering pages to end users. A cached page is a static version of a web page.

In this article, we'll discuss top three static site generator (in terms of their stars on GitHub):
1.  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
2.  [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)
3.  [Hexo](https://hexo.io)
